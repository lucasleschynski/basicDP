Some simple dynamic programming for implementation practice. 

## Coin Changing

In coin_changing.py, there are both (naive) recursive and dynamic programming implementations of code solving the coin changing problem (finding the most "efficient" combination of coin change that sums to a given number).

## Edit Distance 

The code in edit_distance.py uses dynamic programming to find the least expensive transformation for a string to be "aligned" with another.
